Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise consisting of 10 questions. Each question demonstrates key OOP concepts such as inheritance across 10 related classes, encapsulation with private fields and public getters/setters, constructors for initialization, user input via Scanner, and a calculation method in the final class (e.g., generateBill()).
The project is structured as a Java application with sub-packages for each question (q1 to q10). It focuses on management systems like Hospital, School, Payroll, etc., as specified in the assignment PDF.
